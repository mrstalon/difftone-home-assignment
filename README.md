**Difftone Home Assignment**

You are asked to create a web application (SAP), consisting of two screens.

First screen - allows the creation of a questionnaire.

Second screen - displays the questionnaire and allows you to answer it.

1. The application should be submitted from a link in (AWS). No DB is needed, only a static
file server.
2. The app should be built using React.js and Material-UI.
3. Proper abstractions, modularisation and state management is desired.

Guidelines: by order of precedence.
1. Must work :) Workarounds are more than welcomed.
2. Wherever you would like to refactor add a "TODO - ..."
3. Readable.
4. Testable.
